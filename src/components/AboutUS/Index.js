              <h1>What Is A Festival?</h1>
              <p>
              Events take place around us all the time, yet there is something different about a festival that transcends everyday experiences and creates a mirror that reflects our own humanity. Similar to love, it is a state that is hard to describe, but we all know it when we feel it.
              </p>
              <p>
              At Everfest, we have created a Fest Test to help guide our mission. We refer to the Fest Test to decide if an event is merely that â€” or if it is something greater: a festival. These are not absolute criteria that will apply in every case, but rather philosophical qualities that are representative in most, and certainly the best, festivals.

              <ol>
                <li>Festivals have an ethos of discovery and are about having fun.</li>
                <li>Festivals are multi-dimensional, encourage participation, and offer various types of activities and stimuli.</li>
                <li>Festivals can include anyone with the means to attend. They may charge for admission but should not discriminate by race, age, gender, religion, or otherwise be private clubs.</li>
                <li>Festivals physically occur in the real world. They remind us that there is a human social network where we meet old and new friends.</li>
                <li>Festivals should be celebrations worthy of the test of time. They should recur or intend to recur.</li>
